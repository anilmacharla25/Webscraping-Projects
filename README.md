1.scrape_data_intosqlite3.py:

This GitHub project is designed to automate the process of updating a SQLite3 database. The client has provided a database file that contains a table with two columns: 'Website' and 'html'. Initially, the 'Website' column is populated with URLs, while the 'html' column is empty.

The purpose of this project is to create a bot that can retrieve the homepage text of each URL and update the corresponding 'html' column in the database. By utilizing this automation process, the database will be enriched with the HTML content of the websites.

This project streamlines the task of populating the 'html' column by eliminating the need for manual retrieval and update of the webpage content. With the bot handling the process, the database can be kept up-to-date effortlessly.


2.webiste_data_scrap.py:

This GitHub project is a Python script designed to automate the process of retrieving and storing search results from a website. The script navigates to a specific website and performs a search using a provided postal code. It then captures all the search results and stores them in a CSV file as the output.

The purpose of this project is to simplify the task of collecting data from the website by eliminating the need for manual search and result extraction. By utilizing this script, users can easily specify a postal code and retrieve all relevant results from the website in a structured CSV format.

This project offers a convenient solution for automating data collection, making it easier to analyze and process information obtained from the website. By storing the results in a CSV file, users can easily import the data into other applications for further analysis or integration with existing systems.
